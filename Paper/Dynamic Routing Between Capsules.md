title: Dynamic Routing Between Capsules

1. In this paper we explore an interesting alternative which is to use the overall length of the vector of instantiation parameters to represent the existence of the entity and to force the orientation of the vector to represent the properties of the entity. (Which means they can not use batch normalization on the layer output, right?)
2.  If this prediction vector has a large scalar product with the output of a (one) possible parent, there is top-down feedback which has the effect of increasing the coupling coefficient for that parent and decreasing it for other parents.
3.  We do not allow an image to contain two instances of the same digit class. We address this weakness of capsules in the discussion section.
