What they try to solve

When deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed: with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. 

Why they try to solve

Many other nontrivial visual recognition tasks [8, 12, 7, 32, 27] have also greatly benefited from very deep models.
