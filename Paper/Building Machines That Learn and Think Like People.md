title: Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People

The "child as scientist" proposal further views the process of learning itself as also scientist-like, with recent experiments showing that children seek out new data to distinguish between hypotheses, isolate variables, test causal hypotheses, make use of the data-generating process in drawing conclusions, and learn selectively from others (Cook, Goodman, & Schulz, 2011; Gweon et al., 2010; L. E. Schulz, Gopnik, & Glymour, 2007; Stahl & Feigenson, 2015; Tsividis, Gershman, Tenenbaum, & Schulz, 2013). 

Beyond the compositionality inherent in parts, objects, and scenes, compositionality can also be important at the level of goals and sub-goals. Recent work on hierarchical-DQNs shows that by providing explicit object representations to a DQN, and then defining sub-goals based on reaching those objects, DQNs can learn to play games with sparse rewards (such as Montezumaâ€™s Revenge) by combining these sub-goals together to achieve larger goals (Kulkarni, Narasimhan, Saeedi, & Tenenbaum, 2016)
