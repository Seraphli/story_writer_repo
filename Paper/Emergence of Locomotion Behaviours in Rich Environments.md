title: Emergence of Locomotion Behaviours in Rich Environments
---

Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment **without explicit reward-based guidance**.

Also, arguably, the requirement of careful reward design sidesteps a primary challenge of reinforcement learning: how an agent can learn for itself, directly from a limited reward signal, to achieve rich and effective behaviours. In this paper we return to this challenge.

Presenting the agent with a diversity of challenges thus increases the performance gap between different solutions and may favor the learning of solutions that are robust across settings.
