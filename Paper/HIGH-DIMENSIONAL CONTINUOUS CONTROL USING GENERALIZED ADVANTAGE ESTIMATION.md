title: HIGH-DIMENSIONAL CONTINUOUS CONTROL USING GENERALIZED ADVANTAGE ESTIMATION

This is a good start for understanding policy gradient.

But the discounted problem can be handled as an instance of the undiscounted problem in which we absorb the discount factor into the reward function, making it time-dependent.

See Greensmith et al. (2004) for a more rigorous analysis of the variance of policy gradient estimators and the effect of using a baseline.
